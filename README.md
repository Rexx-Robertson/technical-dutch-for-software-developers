Technical Dutch For English Learners
==================================

These are my dutch notes based on technical context. I'm a software developer working in a dutch company, and because the daily used language and the documentation is in dutch, I am making an independent repository totally dedicated to dutch language in the context of IT.

Please check this repository periodically because this repo is going to be evolved as I progress.

This repository consist of several parts such as vocabulary, adjectives/adverbs, verbs and examples.

I'll update this repository as I progress so please check this repository periodically.

**TIP**: Please note that it would be better to study this repository in addition with my other dutch language related repositories;

- Dutch Vocabulary repository: [dutch-vocabulary](https://github.com/bzdgn/dutch-vocabulary/blob/master/README.md#toc)
- Dutch Grammar repository: [dutch-grammar-for-english-learners](https://github.com/bzdgn/dutch-grammar-for-english-learners#toc)
