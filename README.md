Technical Dutch For English Learners
==================================

These are my dutch notes based on technical context. I'm a software developer working in a dutch company, and because the daily used language and the documentation is in dutch, I am making an independent repository totally dedicated to dutch language in the context of IT.

Please check this repository periodically because this repo is going to be evolved as I progress.
